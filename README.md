# Game of War

Game of War is a web-based card game project that simulates the classic card game "War." The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging an external API for card data and shuffling to enhance gameplay.

## Features
- **Card Gameplay**: Two players (Player and Computer) take turns drawing cards.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the Deck of Cards API for generating and shuffling card decks.
- **Winning Rules**: The player with the higher card wins the round, and the winner collects both cards.
- **Deck Management**: A full deck of cards is dynamically fetched and managed through the API.
- **Victory Condition**: The game ends when one player has all the cards.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and visual enhancements.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic and interactivity.
- **API**: Deck of Cards API for managing cards and shuffling.
